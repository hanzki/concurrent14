<h1>Assignment 2: Task A: Tuple space</h1>

<p>
  The tuple space implementation must be thread-safe (any method may
  be called at any time by any thread), but it need not be capable of
  communication between virtual machines; however, it must be capable
  of working with the example network tuple
  space proxy and server.
</p>

<h2>Tuple space API</h2>

<p>
  Your tuple space implementation must conform to the following
  specification:
</p>

<p>
  All the classes below are in package <code>tuplespaces</code>.
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    
    <code>public class LocalTupleSpace implements TupleSpace</code>

    <ul>

      <li>

	<code>public LocalTupleSpace()</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Create an empty tuple space (a bag of tuples that
	    are represented by <code>String</code> arrays).
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>
    
    <code>public interface TupleSpace</code>

    <ul>

      <li>

        <code>public String[] get(String... pattern)</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Remove and return a tuple (an array of entries) matching
	    <code>pattern</code> (which may not be <code>null</code>)
	    from tuple space. Block until one is available. A tuple
	    matches a pattern if both have the same amount of entries
	    and every entry matches. A <code>null</code> entry in the
	    pattern matches any object in that entry in the tuple. Any
	    other object <code>p</code> in the pattern matches any
	    object <code>t</code> in the corresponding entry in the
	    tuple for which <code>p.equals(t)</code> (i.e. contains
	    the same character string). If several matching tuples are
	    found in the tuple space, any one of them may be returned.
	  </li>

          <li>
	    The returned tuple must have exactly the same textual
	    contents as the tuple that was <code>put</code> (contain
	    the same amount of <code>String</code> objects as the
	    original and each <code>String equals</code> the
	    <code>String</code> in the same position in the original),
	    but may be a different array object and may contain
	    different <code>String</code> objects.
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

      <li>

        <code>public String[] read(String... pattern)</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Return but do not remove a tuple (an array of entries) matching
	    <code>pattern</code> (which may not be <code>null</code>)
	    from tuple space. Block until one is available. A tuple
	    matches a pattern if both have the same amount of entries
	    and every entry matches. A <code>null</code> entry in the
	    pattern matches any object in that entry in the tuple. Any
	    other object <code>p</code> in the pattern matches any
	    object <code>t</code> in the corresponding entry in the
	    tuple for which <code>p.equals(t)</code> (i.e. contains
	    the same character string). If several matching tuples are
	    found in the tuple space, any one of them may be returned.
	    A <code>read</code> may or may not see a newly added matching tuple before
	    it is removed by a <code>get</code> that also matches the tuple.
	  </li>

          <li>
	    The returned tuple must have exactly the same textual
	    contents as the tuple that was <code>put</code> (contain
	    the same amount of <code>String</code> objects as the
	    original and each <code>String equals</code> the
	    <code>String</code> in the same position in the original),
	    but may be a different array object and may contain
	    different <code>String</code> objects.
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

      <li>

	<code>public void put(String... tuple)</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Insert <code>tuple</code> in tuple
	    space. <code>tuple</code> is an array of any length
	    greater than zero and is not
	    <code>null</code>. <code>tuple</code> may not contain
	    <code>null</code> values. Tuples stored in the tuple space
	    may not be affected by changes made to the <code>tuple</code> array
	    after <code>put</code> has completed.
          </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Concurrency and synchronisation requirements</h2>

<p>
  Synchronisation in the tuple space system must be done using nothing
  but the basic Java synchronisation primitives (those built into the
  language and <code>java.lang</code>, not
  <code>java.util.concurrent</code>).  Inefficient solutions, such as
  polling and busy-waiting, will be rejected. Use of unsafe methods
  such as <code>java.lang.Thread.destroy()</code> will also lead to
  rejection.
</p>

<p>
  Interruption of tuple space operations is not permitted; the results of doing
  so are undefined.
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Although it is possible to create a fast tuple matching algorithm
    using a lot of indexing, this assignment is not about indexing. An
    algorithm that performs reasonably well in most cases is enough
    for our purposes; efficient use of threads is more important than
    efficient matching. 
  </li>    
  <li> 
    Optimising for your chat implementation is a
    good idea, but beware of making your tuple space chat-specific!
  </li>
  <li>
    Testing your tuple space implementation with a lot of concurrent
    threads putting and getting tuples at once is a very good idea.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can use <code>System.err</code> for debug output. Using
    <code>System.out</code> is not allowed.
  </li>
</ul>
