<h1>Assignment 2: Task B: Chat system</h1>

<p>
  The chat system is based on channels (or "chat rooms") (identified
  by
  <code>String</code>s) to which messages can be sent. It is also
  possible to listen to a channel. When a listener connects to a
  channel, the first messages it must receive are the <em>rows</em>
  last messages (or the total amount sent to the channel, whichever is
  less) sent to the channel before connection (where <em>rows</em> is
  a value specified at server startup). After that, the listener must
  receive all messages sent to the channel since it connected to it,
  in the order they are sent, until it disconnects from the channel.
</p>

<p>
  The chat server is a distributed system running on multiple nodes
  (e.g. WWW servers, SMS gateways, TV outputs) connected by a tuple
  space. All nodes run a Java process containing a
  <code>ChatServer</code> object which can be used by many threads
  within the node at once to access the chat system. All nodes share
  channels; i.e. messages sent on one node must reach listeners to
  that channel on all other nodes using the same tuple space.
</p>

<h2>Chat system API</h2>

<p>
  The chat system must conform to the following:
</p>

<p>
  All the classes below are in package <code>chat</code>:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>

    <code>public class ChatServer</code>

    <ul>

      <li>

	<code>public ChatServer(TupleSpace t, int
	rows, String[] channelNames)</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Create a new chat server with a set of channels identified
	    by the <code>String</code>s in <code>channelNames</code>
	    and a buffer of <code>rows</code> messages for each
	    channel (the <code>rows</code> last messages must be sent
	    to new listeners connecting to the channel, if available)
	    in empty tuple space <code>t</code>. Only one channel set
	    may be created in each tuple space. Channel names consist
	    of 1 or more alphabetic characters and are unique and
	    case-sensitive.
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

      <li>

        <code>public ChatServer(TupleSpace t)</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Connect to a chat server created with the above
	    method using tuple space <code>t</code>.
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li>

	<code>public void writeMessage(String channel,
	String message)</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Write message <code>message</code> to channel
	    <code>channel</code>. This call may block if there is no
	    space in the buffer to write the message.
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

      <li>

        <code>public ChatListener openConnection(String
	channel)</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Open a listening connection to <code>channel</code>.
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

      <li>

        <code>public String[] getChannels()</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Return list of channels.
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>

    <code>public class ChatListener</code>

    <ul>

      <li>
        You may assume that each <code>ChatListener</code> is used by
        only one thread.
      </li>

      <li>

        <code>public String getNextMessage()</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Get the next message from the channel. If no message
	    exists, wait until it appears.
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

      <li>

        <code>public void closeConnection()</code>

        <ul>

          <li>
	    Disconnect the <code>ChatListener</code> from the
	    channel. After this, the <code>ChatListener</code> may not
	    be used any more.
	  </li>

        </ul>

      </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

</ul>

<p>
  All parameters above are non-<code>null</code>.
</p>

<h2>Message ordering requirements</h2>

<p>
  The order of messages on channels must be consistent across the
  different listeners on a channel (if one message precedes another,
  it does so for all listeners) and consistent with the order messages
  are written (if one <code>writeMessage</code> completes before
  another starts, the message written by the first precedes the
  message written by the second, even if the writes are to different channels).
</p>

<h2>ChatUI</h2>

<p>
  For testing purposes, you can use the example chat system user interface. To start it, run:
</p>

<p>
  <kbd>
    java chatui.ChatUI
    <strong>
      &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
      [&lt;buffer size&gt;
      [&lt;channel name 1&gt;
      [&lt;channel name 2&gt;
      [...]]]]
    </strong>
  </kbd>
</p>

<p>
  <kbd><strong>&lt;host&gt;</strong></kbd> and
  <kbd><strong>&lt;port&gt;</strong></kbd> are the host name and TCP
  port of an active tuple server. Specify the buffer size and channel
  names to create a new set of channels in the tuple space (you may
  assume that only one set of channels is created in each tuple
  space).
</p>

<h3>Usage example</h3>

<p>
  ChatUI requires a running tuple space
  server (in the example code). To start a new <code>TupleServer</code> containing an
  empty tuple space:
</p>
<p>
  <kbd>
    java tupleserver.TupleServer
  </kbd>
</p>
<p>
  The command prints out the TCP port the server listens on.
</p>

<p>
  To start ChatUI creating three channels
   (<em>ONE</em>, <em>TWO</em>, <em>THREE</em>) with a buffer of
   10 <em>rows</em> to an empty tuple space server which runs on local
   computer in TCP port 12345:
</p>
<p>
  <kbd>
    java chatui.ChatUI localhost:12345 10 ONE TWO THREE
  </kbd>
</p>
<p>
  To start second (or third, fourth, etc) ChatUI connecting to the
  same tuple space server and using the same channels as created above:
</p>
<p>
  <kbd>
    java chatui.ChatUI localhost:12345
  </kbd>
</p>
<p>
  Now you should be able to chat between the ChatUIs on the same
  channels. A message written in one ChatUI should be visible in all
  ChatUIs connected to the same tuple space.
</p>

<p>
  For further convenience, a user interface for starting chat user interfaces
  is provided as class <code>chatui.MetaUI</code>.
</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>
  The system must be
  capable of working between machines connected only through the tuple
  space. In other words, it may not assume that all threads in the distributed
  system are reachable through any other mechanism than the tuple space.
</p>
<p>
  Each ChatUI client creates an instance of
  the <code>ChatServer</code> class. There are one or
  more <code>ChatServer</code> instances, which communicate with each
  other through the tuple space. Each <code>ChatServer</code> instance
  provides the same chat services to the ChatUI that created it.
</p>

<h2>Concurrency and synchronisation requirements</h2>

<p>
  The chat system must work in a distributed environment connected only
  through a tuple space. Each
  <code>ChatListener</code> is used by only one thread at a
  time. However, a <code>ChatServer</code> may be used by multiple
  threads. 
</p>

<h2>Error handling</h2>

<p>
  To keep this assignment simple, you may ignore many of the errors a
  tuple space implementation may face. For example, the
  <code>put</code> and <code>get</code> operations in this simplified
  implementation may not fail. In a real distributed tuple space
  implementation, many bad things can happen such as connection
  failures and timeouts. You may assume that no node is removed from
  the distributed chat system while an operation is pending or a
  listener is active (the nodes are all servers on the same corporate
  net, and if that fails everything breaks anyway).
</p>

<p>
  Throwing exceptions in the case of invalid parameters is recommended
  but not required.
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    The chat system should not leave obsolete tuples (e.g. old messages which
    have been read by everyone and are no longer in the buffer) in the
    tuplespace, since this would eventually consume all of the memory in
    the system and crash it.
  </li>

  <li>
    Calls to <code>writeMessage</code> should block if the channel buffer 
    is full of unread messages to prevent fast producers from filling the
    tuplespace with messages.
  </li>

  <li>
    Tuples can easily be used like semaphores, so similar
    synchronisation techniques apply.
  </li>

  <li>
    A chat channel is like a bounded buffer, except it has multiple
    readers that all get the same data. Test accordingly.
  </li>

  <li>
    You can use <code>System.err</code> for debug output. Using
    <code>System.out</code> is not allowed.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Dos and don'ts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can assume that the tuplespace and the underlying network work
    perfectly and without catastrophics failures, such as disconnects
    or network partitioning.
  </li>
  <li>
    To ensure your solution works when threads are on different systems,
    avoid using shared fields in <code>ChatServer</code>. A
    single <code>ChatServer</code> may be used by several threads, but
    you cannot assume Java synchronization will work between all threads
    in the system. Declaring all fields
    in <code>ChatServer</code> <code>final</code> is recommended;
    after the <code>ChatServer</code> constructor method has
    finished, the fields should not be modified.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use local variables in methods
    of <code>ChatServer</code>. Variables defined inside a method are
    allocated from stack, causing the variables to be visible to one
    thread only.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't use <code>LocalTupleSpace</code> directly. Use only
    the <code>TupleSpace</code> interface and its methods.
  </li>
</ul>
