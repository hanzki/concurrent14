<h1>Assignment 2 â€” Tuple space</h1>

<p>
  In this assignment, you will implement an interprocess communication
  mechanism and use it for a simple chat system.  In the following,
  "should" is used to denote a weak requirement; something
  characteristic of a good solution. "must" and "may not" denote
  strong requirements; failure to achieve these in your own code may
  cause your assignment to be failed; conversely, you may assume that
  all requirements on other code marked using these always hold.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
  You have been assigned to write a prototype for a new
  platform-independent chat system that is intended to allow users to
  participate in a conversation from a wide range of devices. To make
  it easier to balance the load between servers and make the system
  less dependent on a specific communcations mechanism, your boss has
  decreed that you use 
  <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2433">tuple spaces</a>
  to distribute messages between threads and the various servers in
  the system. Your job is to implement a basic tuple space system (the
  design team is still arguing about which tuple space implementation
  to use) and get the message distribution part of the chat system
  running.
</p>

<h2>Task descriptions</h2>

<p>
  Your task is to write a simple tuple space implementation using
  standard Java synchronisation mechanisms and use it for the message
  passing part of a simple chat system. These are two separate tasks;
  your tuple space implementation must work with any compliant chat
  system implementation and vice versa. <strong>Both tasks must be
  completed well to pass the assignment. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The tasks are described on separate pages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/Studies/T-106.5600/2014/pa2/tuplespace.shtml">Task A: Tuple space</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/Studies/T-106.5600/2014/pa2/chat.shtml">Task B: Chat system</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
  You should download the <a href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/Studies/T-106.5600/2014/pa2/hw2skeleton.zip">project skeleton code and build scripts</a>.
  An additional <a href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/Studies/T-106.5600/2014/pa2/tupletest.jar">tester</a> is available (<a href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/Studies/T-106.5600/2014/pa2/test.pdf">documentation</a>).
  See <a href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/Studies/T-106.5600/2014/pa2/eclipse.shtml">Eclipse instructions</a> for getting started.
</p>

<p>
  The test JAR may fail on some systems (i.e.. Windows) if it is placed in a folder 
  that has spaces in it's full path. This manifests as <code>ClassNotFoundExceptions</code>
  If the tests throw <code>VerifyErrors</code>, switch your compiler compiliance target to 
  version 1.5 or 1.6. To do this use the <code>-target</code> compiler argument or under
  Eclipse, go to Project Properties -&gt; Java Compiler -&gt; Compiler complience level.
</p>

<h2>General requirements</h2>

<h3>Specifications and concurrency</h3>

<p>
  Your code must work exactly as described in the assignment
  specification and in the task descriptions. Any deviations may cause
  you to fail the assignment! If you're not sure about something, ask
  in the course newsgroup.
</p>

<p>
  Perfectly correct concurrency in your code is required. Design your
  code before writing it, and try to keep the concurrency simple. Read
  your code through line-by-line and examine if there is any
  concurrent execution elsewhere that may cause problems. Even minor
  concurrency problems in your code may cause you to get a lower grade
  or fail the assignment.
</p>

<p>
  Efficient use of concurrency is encouraged. Inefficient use of concurrency
  constructs will result in a lower grade.
</p>

<h3>Style requirements</h3>

<p>
  The program should be written in clear, reasonably object-oriented
  Java. We will not accept programs that are hard to read, violate
  basic object-oriented programming principles or contain a large
  amount of repeated code with minor variations. Cryptic method and
  variable names should not be used.
</p>

<p>
  Explanatory comments are required for code that is not
  self-explanatory to a programmer fluent in Java. However, you should
  not clutter your program by stating the obvious. Javadoc comments describing
  the required methods are unnecessary but tolerated. Also, please bear
  in mind that your programs will be read by people who are familiar
  with the specification; there is no need to repeat the requirements in your
  comments.
</p>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>
  Comments, variable and method names and reports may be written in English.
</p>


<h2>Plan</h2>

<p>
	You are required to submit a plan for how you intend to implement the required 
    functionality in all parts of the project. In particular, you should explain, at
	least in terms of pseudocode, the synchronisation and waiting algorithms you
	intend to use to implement the tuple space operations as well as how you use the
    tuple space to transfer messages in the chat system. The plan should not exceed 
    2-4 A4 pages of 10-12 point text.  Please focus on explaining your reasoning rather
    than what your solution does in detail. Refer to the specification when appropritate,
    but do not needlessly repeat it (e.g. your plan should not be a verbatim "rewrite" 
    of the specification).
</p>

<p>The deadline for the plan is 2014-11-23 23:59.</p>

<h2>Final submission</h2>

<p>
 Submission is through <a href="https://optima.aalto.fi/">Optima</a>.
 Note that multiple submissions are allowed; the last one will be assessed. The deadline is 2014-12-21 23:59. 
 Your submission must contain:
</p>

<table border="1">

  <tbody><tr>

    <td>
      <code>tuplespaces/</code>
    </td>

    <td>
      The Java (version 1.5 or 1.6) source code of your tuple
      space implementation (the directory corresponds to the
      <code>tuplespaces</code> package).
    </td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>
      <code>chat/</code>
    </td>

    <td>
      The Java (version 1.5 or 1.6) source code of your chat
      system implementation (the directory corresponds to the
      <code>chat</code> package).
    </td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>report.pdf</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      The report describing your solution (as PDF).
    </td>
  </tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>
  Your program will be compiled and run with the standard library and tuple server included in the classpath.
</p>

<p>
  You may work in pairs. The grading does not depend on whether you are working alone or in a pair.
</p>

<h3>Report</h3>

<p>
	Your submission must contain a report describing briefly:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
    	The reasoning behind your solution, in particular:
 		<ul>
  			<li>how the tuple space ensures correctness</li>
			<li>how the chat system ensures that messages are not lost or duplicated </li>
			<li>how the message order is kept consistent across listeners</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    <li>
    	A list of all the tuple types used an a description of what they are used for
    </li>
	<li>
    	What measures you have taken to ensure your solution is correct (e.g. model checking, proofs, testing).   
	</li>
	<li>
    	Any unexpected behaviour you may have encountered during testing and how you have investigated and resolved it.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
The report should not exceed 2-4 A4 pages of 10-12 point text, excluding diagrams and other graphics. 
Please focuson explaining your reasoning rather than what your solution does in detail.
