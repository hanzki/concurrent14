This project was created for a course on concurrent programming. Some 
of the code (tests, interfaces, game logic) were provided as starting 
point. The code uses java concurrency primitives instead of much more
useful and preferable java.util.concurrent package because this was
a limitation during the course.

USAGE:
You can start a hangman server by running the HangmanServer.java with
two arguments first of which is the word to guess (in lowercase) and
second is the ammount of wrong guesses which are allowed before the 
game ends.

HangmanServer <word to guess> <number of failed attempts before termination>

This prints out the portnumber which the server uses. After starting the
server any tcp client (ex. netcat) can be used to connect to the server.
After connection user has to provide a username and after that he can 
start to make guesses by sending a single lowercase letter to the server.
The server supports multiple concurrent users.
